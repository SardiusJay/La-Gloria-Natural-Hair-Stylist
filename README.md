# About

La Gloria Hair was founded with the vision of creating a welcoming and inclusive space where individuals with natural hair textures could receive expert care and support, whilst avoiding the use of hair relaxers and texturizers.We identified a common challenge among many women who struggle to find or maintain a quality salon for proper hair care, leading them to resort to relaxers or texturizers, potentially increasing vulnerability to uterine cancer. Our initiative aims to address this issue by offering comprehensive training and services across various locations in Nigeria and beyond, engaging in awareness campaigns about the negative impact of relaxers on the health, empowering women to embrace healthier hair care practices.We strive to become the go-to destination for those seeking expert care and styling for their natural hair. Our salon will offer a range of services, including bridals, plaiting, styling, product formulation, treatments, consultations, trainings, coaching and mentorship, all delivered by skilled professionals committed to promoting seamless, healthy hair practices and celebrating natural beauty.
